The hokies thrift website will be a place for my instagram followers to be redirected to so they can purchase and sell Vintage Virginia Tech gear to or from me. The website should have a few different tabs. One tab should be the landing page or home page. This page will connect my different socials and give the consumer an idea of our mission. The home page will also have a countdown to the next drop and different quick links to the other pages. Another page should be where the consumer can see available items and upcoming drops, another page should have a seller submission form so the individual can submit something they would like to sell and get an idea of how much they can make off the item by selling through hokies thrift, and another page should be a tab where people can search for virginia tech gear on all second hand platfroms but sydicated over to this page for easy browsing. This page will link the gear and allow me to get comission using the links if someone purchases and item (similar to the platform Gem).
